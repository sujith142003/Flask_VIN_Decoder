ðŸš€ "Automatic Barcode Generator as per Plan (AI with VIN Decoder)"

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project automates barcode creation for manufacturing workflows using AI, OCR, and VIN decoding.
Instead of manually creating labels, the system reads a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), decodes it, matches it with the manufacturing plan, and instantly generates an accurate barcode â€” saving time, reducing human errors, and improving efficiency.

âœ¨ Features
VIN Decoding â€“ Reads and extracts manufacturing details from the VIN.

AI + OCR Integration â€“ Uses Tesseract OCR for accurate VIN recognition.

Auto Barcode Generation â€“ Creates barcodes instantly using Python libraries.

Plan Matching â€“ Links VIN details with the correct manufacturing plan.

Error Reduction â€“ Minimizes manual data entry and mistakes.

Seamless Integration â€“ Fits easily into existing manufacturing workflows.
